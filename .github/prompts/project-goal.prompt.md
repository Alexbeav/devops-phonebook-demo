# Context
This project is a CI/CD lab meant to showcase my ability to build a secure, automated GitOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Argo CD, and Helm. It is part of my effort to transition into a DevOps role.

# Style
Provide reusable patterns, explain best practices, and help me refine YAML, Terraform, or Kubernetes manifests for clarity and correctness.

# Tools
GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Argo CD, GHCR, Terraform, Docker

# Request Format
When I ask for help, assume I want to understand why something is done this way and how to generalize it for future reuse.

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of applications using GitOps principles. This includes:
- Setting up a secure and efficient GitHub Actions workflow
- Implementing Helm charts for application packaging
- Using Argo CD for continuous delivery
- Ensuring all components are monitored and secure  
- Providing clear documentation and contribution guidelines

This project aims to build a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of applications using GitOps principles. Key objectives include:
- **Secure GitHub Actions Workflow**: Implement a secure and efficient CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- **Helm Charts**: Create reusable Helm charts for packaging applications.
- **Argo CD Integration**: Use Argo CD for continuous delivery and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Security**: Ensure all components are monitored and secure, including Prometheus and Grafana for observability, and Trivy for vulnerability scanning.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation and contribution guidelines to facilitate collaboration and onboarding of new contributors.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plan for future improvements such as automated tests, semantic versioning, Terraform for cloud infrastructure, and advanced delivery/logging solutions like Argo Rollouts and Loki.
This project serves as a practical demonstration of my DevOps skills and my ability to build scalable,  secure, and maintainable CI/CD pipelines.
- **Collaboration**: Foster a collaborative environment by providing clear contribution guidelines and encouraging community involvement        
- **Future Improvements**: Plan for future enhancements such as automated tests, semantic versioning, Terraform for cloud infrastructure, and advanced delivery/logging solutions like Argo Rollouts and Loki.
